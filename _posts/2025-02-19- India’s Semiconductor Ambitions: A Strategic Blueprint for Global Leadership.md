## **Introduction: The Semiconductors Surge**

In an era where **semiconductors power everything** from smartphones to electric vehicles, global demand for chips has skyrocketed. The semiconductor industry, valued at over **$600 billion in 2024**, is projected to exceed **$1 trillion by 2030**. Nations worldwide are investing billions to safeguard supply chains and gain technological supremacy. Yet, amid this semiconductor gold rush, one of the world’s largest consumer markets, **India**, remains conspicuously absent from the global supply chain.

After decades of lagging behind, India is making a **strategic leap into semiconductor manufacturing**, backed by ambitious policies, significant investments, and strategic partnerships. But can India, a country with no established semiconductor fab, challenge giants like **Taiwan’s TSMC**, **South Korea’s Samsung**, and **China’s SMIC**?

This article explores India’s **semiconductor roadmap**, reasons for its historical lag, strategic choices, and a comprehensive blueprint for success.


## **1. Why India Lagged in Semiconductor Manufacturing**

India’s delayed entry into semiconductor manufacturing is a product of historical, economic, and strategic miscalculations. Unlike Taiwan, South Korea, or China, which recognized the strategic importance of semiconductors early on, India focused on **software over hardware**, becoming an IT powerhouse while neglecting chip manufacturing.

### **(A) Historical Policy Gaps and Missed Opportunities**
- **1984:** India established the **Semiconductor Complex Limited (SCL)** in Chandigarh, but it failed to scale due to **inadequate investment and outdated technology**.
- **2007 & 2013:** Despite policy attempts to establish fabs, **lack of coherent strategy, insufficient government incentives, and high infrastructure costs** led to failed initiatives.
- **Focus on IT, Not Semiconductors:** While Taiwan and South Korea invested in fabs, **India focused on IT services (Infosys, TCS, Wipro)**, leading to a **design-rich but fabrication-poor ecosystem**.

### **(B) Absence of Strategic Investments and Supply Chain Development**
- Taiwan’s **TSMC** and South Korea’s **Samsung** became global leaders due to **government-backed investments, tax incentives, and strategic R&D funding**.
- India **lacked the strategic vision** to invest heavily in chip manufacturing, supply chain logistics, or semiconductor R&D.
- As a result, **Indian companies became dependent on imports**, contributing to a **$24 billion electronics import deficit in 2023.**

### **(C) Inadequate Domestic Demand and Ecosystem**
- Unlike China, which grew its semiconductor industry through **massive domestic demand**, India historically relied on imports for consumer electronics.
- The absence of a **robust local ecosystem** of suppliers, packaging, and testing units hindered India’s chip manufacturing aspirations.

### **(D) Technological and Talent Constraints**
- India has strong **chip design talent** (Intel India, Qualcomm India), but lacks **hands-on manufacturing expertise**.
- Absence of **advanced semiconductor research institutes** and collaboration with global leaders limited technological know-how.



## **2. Why Now? The Geopolitical and Economic Imperatives**

### **(A) Global Chip Shortage and Geopolitical Shifts**
- The **US-China trade war** and **COVID-19 pandemic** exposed the global semiconductor supply chain's vulnerabilities.
- **70% of the world’s semiconductors are produced by Taiwan and South Korea**, making global tech giants heavily dependent on a politically sensitive region.
- Countries are now looking for **China+1 strategies**, positioning India as a **viable alternative** for semiconductor manufacturing.

### **(B) Strategic Timing and Government Push**
- In **2021**, India launched the **Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) Scheme** worth **₹76,000 crores ($10 billion)** to attract global semiconductor firms.
- The scheme offers **50% capital subsidy, tax incentives, and infrastructure support** to build fabs in India.
- Global giants like **Micron, Foxconn, and Tata Electronics** have shown interest, signaling a shift in India’s semiconductor narrative.

### **(C) Rising Domestic Demand and Economic Potential**
- India’s **electronics market is expected to reach $400 billion by 2025**, driven by growth in **smartphones, electric vehicles, and IoT devices.**
- By localizing semiconductor manufacturing, India can **reduce import dependency**, boost local employment, and **gain strategic autonomy**.

## **3. Why Focus on 28-110nm Chips? A Strategic Choice**

India’s decision to focus on **mature nodes (28-110nm)** rather than competing in cutting-edge 3-7nm chips is a **pragmatic and strategic choice**.

### **(A) Economic and Market Factors**
- **High Investment, Long ROI for Advanced Nodes:** Building 3-5nm fabs require **$10-15 billion** in investment and **over 10 years to break even**, by which time the technology becomes obsolete.
- **Stable Demand for Mature Nodes:** Chips with 28-110nm nodes are extensively used in:
  - **Automotive Electronics (EVs, ADAS)**
  - **Telecom Equipment (5G base stations)**
  - **Industrial Automation (IoT sensors)**
- These applications require **high reliability and long life-cycles**, making **mature nodes highly profitable.**

### **(B) Lower Technological Barriers and Cost Efficiency**
- **Mature nodes require simpler manufacturing processes** and lower R&D costs, reducing barriers to entry.
- They **do not require EUV (Extreme Ultraviolet) lithography**, which is highly complex and monopolized by **ASML (Netherlands)**.

### **(C) Competitive Positioning and Differentiation**
- By focusing on mature nodes, **India avoids direct competition with Taiwan’s TSMC and South Korea’s Samsung** in the advanced chip market.
- Instead, India can position itself as a **global hub for high-reliability chips**, serving **automotive, industrial, and telecom sectors**.

## **4. Raw Material Reality: Can India Use Thar Desert Sand?**

### **(A) The Myth of Silicon Abundance**
- **Yes, silicon is made from sand,** but not just any sand. Semiconductor-grade silicon requires **99.9999999% purity (7N silicon),** which is derived from **high-purity quartzite**.
- The **Thar Desert’s sand** is **too fine and contains impurities** (iron, aluminum), unsuitable for semiconductor-grade silicon without **extensive refining.**
- **High-purity quartzite reserves** suitable for semiconductor manufacturing are found in **Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Jharkhand**.

### **(B) India’s Strategic Path for Raw Materials**
- **India should invest in quartzite-to-silicon processing plants** in **Tamil Nadu and Odisha**.
- India must **import high-purity silicon wafers** from **Japan, South Korea, or the US** in the short term while developing its own refining capabilities.

## **5. Differentiation Strategy: How Can India Compete Globally?**

### **(A) Competitive Cost Advantage**
- **India’s labor costs are 30-40% lower** than Taiwan and South Korea.
- By leveraging **cost-efficient manufacturing and government subsidies**, India can attract **price-sensitive markets (automotive, industrial IoT).**

### **(B) Strategic Partnerships and Global Alliances**
- Partner with **US, Japan, and European chip giants** for technology transfers.
- Collaborate with **ASML (Netherlands)** for access to lithography tools.

### **(C) Supply Chain Localization and Infrastructure Development**
- Develop a **domestic supply chain for chemicals, gases, and packaging**.
- Attract global **OSAT (Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Testing)** players to set up units in India.

### **(D) Talent and Workforce Development**
- Collaborate with **IITs, IISc, and international universities** for semiconductor-specific education.
- Facilitate **internships and training programs** with **TSMC (Taiwan), Samsung (South Korea), and Intel (US)**.



## **Conclusion: Can India Become a Semiconductor Powerhouse?**
India’s ambition to become a **semiconductor leader** is **ambitious but achievable** if executed with strategic foresight, industry partnerships, and sustained policy support.

✅ **Short-Term Goal:** Master mature nodes (28-110nm) to capture automotive, telecom, and industrial markets.  
✅ **Long-Term Goal:** Gradually move to advanced nodes (14nm and below) by **2035**, leveraging a **well-trained workforce and strategic global partnerships**.

**India’s time to lead the semiconductor industry is now.** With the right strategy, it can emerge as a **global semiconductor powerhouse** by 2040.
